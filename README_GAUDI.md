```
$ docker build -f Dockerfile.hpu -t vllm-hpu-env  .
$ docker run -it --runtime=habana -e HABANA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e OMPI_MCA_btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none --cap-add=sys_nice --net=host --rm vllm-hpu-env
```

> [!TIP]
> If you are facing the following error: `docker: Error response from daemon: Unknown runtime specified habana.`, please refer to the "Install Optional Packages" section
of [Install Driver and Software](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Driver_Installation.html#install-driver-and-software) and "Configure Container
Runtime" section of [Docker Installation](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation_Methods/Docker_Installation.html#configure-container-runtime).
Make sure you have ``habanalabs-container-runtime`` package installed and that ``habana`` container runtime is registered.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Use with Red Hat OpenShift AI

```
$ docker build -f Dockerfile.hpu.ubi -t vllm-hpu-env  .
$ docker run -it --runtime=habana -e HABANA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e OMPI_MCA_btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none --cap-add=sys_nice --net=host --rm vllm-hpu-env
```

## Build from Source

### Environment Verification
To verify that the Intel Gaudi software was correctly installed, run the following:

```{.console}
$ hl-smi # verify that hl-smi is in your PATH and each Gaudi accelerator is visible
$ apt list --installed | grep habana # verify that habanalabs-firmware-tools, habanalabs-graph, habanalabs-rdma-core, habanalabs-thunk and habanalabs-container-runtime are installed
$ pip list | grep habana # verify that habana-torch-plugin, habana-torch-dataloader, habana-pyhlml and habana-media-loader are installed
$ pip list | grep neural # verify that neural-compressor is installed
```

Refer to [System Verification and Final Tests](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/System_Verification_and_Final_Tests.html) for more details.

### Run Docker Image

It is highly recommended to use the latest Docker image from the Intel Gaudi vault.
Refer to the [Intel Gaudi documentation](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Bare_Metal_Fresh_OS.html#pull-prebuilt-containers) for more details.

Use the following commands to run a Docker image. Make sure to update the versions below as listed in the [Support Matrix](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Support_Matrix/Support_Matrix.html):

```{.console}
$ docker pull vault.habana.ai/gaudi-docker/1.21.3/ubuntu22.04/habanalabs/pytorch-installer-2.6.0:latest
$ docker run -it --runtime=habana -e HABANA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all -e OMPI_MCA_btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none --cap-add=sys_nice --net=host --ipc=host vault.habana.ai/gaudi-docker/1.21.3/ubuntu22.04/habanalabs/pytorch-installer-2.6.0:latest
```

### Build and Install vLLM

Currently, multiple ways are provided which can be used to install vLLM with Intel® Gaudi®, pick **one** option:

#### 1. Build and Install the stable version

vLLM releases are being performed periodically to align with Intel® Gaudi® software releases. The stable version is released with a tag, and supports fully validated features and performance optimizations in Gaudi's [vLLM-fork](https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork). To install the stable release from [HabanaAI/vLLM-fork](https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork), run the following:

```{.console}
$ git clone https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork.git
$ cd vllm-fork
$ git checkout v0.8.5+Gaudi-1.21.3
$ pip install -r requirements-hpu.txt
$ python setup.py develop
```

#### 2. Build and Install the latest from vLLM-fork

Currently, the latest features and performance optimizations are being developed in Gaudi's [vLLM-fork](https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork) and periodically upstreamed to the vLLM main repository.
To install latest [HabanaAI/vLLM-fork](https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork), run the following:

```{.console}
$ git clone https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork.git
$ cd vllm-fork
$ git checkout habana_main
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -r requirements-hpu.txt
$ python setup.py develop
```

#### 3. Build and Install from the vLLM main source

If you prefer to build and install directly from the main vLLM source, where periodically we are upstreaming new features, run the following:

```{.console}
$ git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git
$ cd vllm
$ pip install -r requirements-hpu.txt
$ python setup.py develop
```

# Performance Tuning

## Execution Modes

Currently, vLLM for HPU supports four execution modes, determined by the selected HPU PyTorch Bridge backend (via the `PT_HPU_LAZY_MODE` environment variable) and the `--enforce-eager` flag.

## Bucketing Mechanism

Intel Gaudi accelerators perform best when operating on models with fixed tensor shapes. [Intel Gaudi Graph Compiler](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Gaudi_Overview/Intel_Gaudi_Software_Suite.html#graph-compiler-and-runtime)
generates optimized binary code that implements the given model topology on Gaudi. In its default configuration, the produced binary code may be highly dependent on input and output tensor shapes, requiring graph recompilation
when encountering tensors with different shapes within the same topology. While these binaries efficiently utilize Gaudi, the compilation process itself can introduce noticeable overhead in end-to-end execution.
In dynamic inference serving scenarios, minimizing the number of graph compilations and reducing the risk of graph compilation occurring during server runtime is important. Currently, this is achieved by
In dynamic inference serving scenarios, minimizing the number of graph compilations and reducing the risk of graph compilation occurring during server runtime is important. Currently, this is achieved by
"bucketing" the model's forward pass across two dimensions: `batch_size` and `sequence_length`.

> [!NOTE]
> Bucketing helps significantly reduce the number of required graphs, but does not handle graph compilation or device code generation. These tasks are performed during the warmup and HPUGraph capture phase.

Bucketing ranges are determined with 3 parameters - `min`, `step`, and `max`. They can be set separately for the prompt and decode phase, and batch size and sequence length dimensions. These parameters
can be observed in logs during vLLM startup:

```{.}

```

`min` determines the lowest value of the bucket. `step` determines the interval between buckets, and `max` determines the upper bound of the bucket. Furthermore, the interval between `min` and `step` has special handling - `min` gets multiplied by consecutive powers of two, until the multiplier is less than or equal to `step`. We call this the ramp-up phase, and it is used for handling lower batch sizes with minimum wastage,
while allowing larger padding on larger batch sizes.

**Example with ramp-up**

```{.}
min = 2, step = 32, max = 64
=> ramp_up = (2, 4, 8, 16)
=> stable = (32, 64)
=> buckets = ramp_up + stable => (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)
```

**Example without ramp-up**

```{.}
min = 128, step = 128, max = 512
=> ramp_up = ()
=> stable = (128, 256, 384, 512)
=> buckets = ramp_up + stable => (128, 256, 384, 512)
```

In the logged scenario, 24 buckets were generated for prompt (prefill) runs, and 48 buckets for decode runs. Each bucket corresponds to a separate optimized device binary for a given model with specified tensor
shapes. Whenever a batch of requests is processed, it is padded across batch and sequence length dimension to the smallest possible bucket.

> [!WARNING]
> If a request exceeds the maximum bucket size in any dimension, it will be processed without padding, and its processing may require a graph compilation, potentially significantly increasing end-to-end latency.
The boundaries of the buckets are user-configurable via environment variables, and upper bucket boundaries can be increased to avoid such scenario.

For example, if a request with 3 sequences, each having a maximum sequence length of 412, is sent to an idle vLLM server, it will be padded and executed as a `(4, 512)` prefill bucket. This is because the `batch_size`
(number of sequences) will be padded to 4 (the nearest batch size dimension higher than 3), and the maximum sequence length will be padded to 512 (the nearest sequence length dimension higher than 412). After the
prefill stage, it will be executed as a `(4, 512)` decode bucket and will remain in this bucket until either the batch dimension changes (e.g., due to a request being completed), in which case it will become
a `(2, 512)` bucket, or the context length increases beyond 512 tokens. It will become a `(4, 640)` bucket at that point.

> [!NOTE]
> Bucketing is transparent to the user – padding in the sequence length dimension is never returned, and padding in the batch dimension does not create new requests.

## Warmup

Warmup is an optional but highly recommended step that occurs before the vLLM server starts listening. It executes a forward pass for each bucket using dummy data. The goal is to pre-compile all graphs
and avoid any graph compilation overhead within bucket boundaries during server runtime. Each warmup step is logged during vLLM startup.

This example uses the same buckets as those in the Bucketing Mechanism section. Each output line corresponds to the execution of a single bucket. When a bucket is executed for the first time, its graph
is compiled and can be reused later, avoiding further graph compilations.

## HPU Graph Capture

[HPU Graphs](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Inference_on_PyTorch/Inference_Using_HPU_Graphs.html) are currently the most performant execution method of vLLM on Intel Gaudi. When HPU Graphs are enabled,
execution graphs will be traced (recorded) ahead of time (after performing warmup), to be later replayed during inference, significantly reducing host overheads. Recording can take large amounts of memory, which
needs to be taken into account when allocating KV cache. Enabling HPU Graphs will impact the number of available KV cache blocks, but vLLM provides user-configurable variables to control memory management.

When HPU Graphs are used, they share the common memory pool ("usable memory") with the KV cache, as determined by the `gpu_memory_utilization` flag (default value is `0.9`). Before the KV cache is allocated,
the model weights are loaded onto the device, and a forward pass of the model is executed on dummy data to estimate memory usage. Only after that, the `gpu_memory_utilization` flag is applied. At its default value,
it marks 90% of the free device memory at that point as usable. Next, the KV cache is allocated, the model is warmed up, and HPU Graphs are captured. The `VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM` environment variable defines
the ratio of memory reserved for HPU Graph capture. With its default value (`VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM=0.1`), 10% of the usable memory will be reserved for graph capture (referred to as "usable graph memory"),
and the remaining 90% will be used for the KV cache. The environment variable `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO` determines the ratio of usable graph memory reserved for prefill and decode graphs. A lower value corresponds to less usable graph memory reserved for the prefill stage. For example, setting `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO=0.2`
reserves 20% of usable graph memory for prefill graphs, while 80% is allocated for decode graphs.

> [!NOTE]
> `gpu_memory_utilization` does not represent the absolute memory usage across the HPU. Instead, it specifies the memory margin after loading the model and running a profile. For example, if a device has 100 GiB of
total memory and 50 GiB of free memory after loading the model weights and executing the profiling run, the default value of `gpu_memory_utilization` will mark 90% of the 50 GiB as usable, leaving 5 GiB as a margin,
regardless of the total device memory.

You can also configure the strategy for capturing HPU graphs separately for the prompt and decode stages. The strategy affects the order in which graphs are captured. Two strategies are implemented:

- `max_bs` - The graph capture queue is sorted in descending order by batch size. Buckets with equal batch sizes are sorted by sequence length in ascending order
  (e.g., `(64, 128)`, `(64, 256)`, `(32, 128)`, `(32, 256)`, `(1, 128)`, `(1,256)`), which is the default strategy for decode.
- `min_tokens` - The graph capture queue is sorted in ascending order by the number of tokens each graph processes (`batch_size*sequence_length`), which is the default strategy for prompt.

When many requests are pending, the vLLM scheduler attempts to fill the maximum batch size for decoding as quickly as possible. Once a request is finished, the decode batch size decreases.
When this happens, vLLM attempts to schedule a prefill iteration for requests in the waiting queue to restore the decode batch size to its previous state. In a fully loaded scenario, the decode
batch size is often at its maximum, making large-batch HPU graphs critical to capture, as indicated by the `max_bs` strategy. Conversely, prefill iterations will typically be executed with very low
batch sizes (1-4), as reflected in the `min_tokens` strategy.

> [!NOTE]
> `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO` does not set a hard limit on the memory allocated for graphs in each stage (prefill and decode). vLLM first attempts to use the entire usable prefill graph memory
(usable graph memory * VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO) to capture prefilled HPU graphs. It will then attempt to do the same for decode graphs and the usable decode graph memory pool. If one stage is fully
captured and there is unused memory remaining in the usable graph memory pool, vLLM will attempt to capture more graphs for the other stage, until no more HPU Graphs can be captured without exceeding
the reserved memory pool. The behavior of this mechanism is illustrated in the example below.

Each step outlined is logged by the vLLM server, with negative values indicating memory release:

## Recommended vLLM Parameters

- It is recommended to run inference on Gaudi 2 with `block_size` of 128 for BF16 data type. Using the default values (16, 32) may result in suboptimal performance due to underutilization of the Matrix
  Multiplication Engine (see [Gaudi Architecture](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Gaudi_Overview/Gaudi_Architecture.html)).
- To achieve maximum throughput on Llama 7B, it is recommended to use a batch size of 128 or 256 and a maximum context length of 2048 with HPU Graphs enabled. If you experience out-of-memory issues,
  please refer to the Troubleshooting section below.

## Environment Variables

**Diagnostic and Profiling Knobs:**

- `VLLM_PROFILER_ENABLED`: if `true` - enables high-level profiler. Resulting JSON traces can be viewed at [perfetto.habana.ai](https://perfetto.habana.ai/#!/viewer). Disabled by default.
- `VLLM_HPU_LOG_STEP_GRAPH_COMPILATION`: if `true` - logs graph compilations for each vLLM engine step, but only if any compilation occurs. It is highly recommended to use this in conjunction with `PT_HPU_METRICS_GC_DETAILS=1`.
  Disabled by default.
- `VLLM_HPU_LOG_STEP_GRAPH_COMPILATION_ALL`: if `true` - logs graph compilations for every vLLM engine step, even if no compilation occurs. Disabled by default.
- `VLLM_HPU_LOG_STEP_CPU_FALLBACKS`: if `true` - logs CPU fallbacks for each vLLM engine step, but only if any fallback occurs. Disabled by default.
- `VLLM_HPU_LOG_STEP_CPU_FALLBACKS_ALL`: if `true` - logs CPU fallbacks for each vLLM engine step, even if no fallback occur. Disabled by default.
- `VLLM_T_COMPILE_FULLGRAPH`: if `true` - PyTorch compile function raises an error if any graph breaks happen during compilation. This allows for the easy detection of existing graph breaks, which usually reduce performance. Disabled by default.
- `VLLM_T_COMPILE_DYNAMIC_SHAPES`: if `true` - PyTorch compiles graph with dynamic options set to None. It causes using dynamic shapes when needed.
- `VLLM_FULL_WARMUP`: if `true` - PyTorch assumes that warmup fully cover all possible tensor sizes and no compilation will occur afterwards. If compilation occurs after warmup, PyTorch will crash (with message like this: `Recompilation triggered with skip_guard_eval_unsafe stance. This usually means that you have not warmed up your model with enough inputs such that you can guarantee no more recompilations.`). If this happens, disable it. `false` by default.

**Performance Tuning Knobs:**

- `VLLM_SKIP_WARMUP`: if `true`, warmup is skipped. The default is `false`.
- `VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM`: percentage of memory dedicated to HPUGraph capture. The default is `0.1`.
- `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO`: percentage of reserved graph memory dedicated to prompt graphs. The default is `0.3`.
- `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_STRATEGY`: strategy determining order of prompt graph capture, `min_tokens` or `max_bs`. The default is `min_tokens`.
- `VLLM_GRAPH_DECODE_STRATEGY`: strategy determining order of decode graph capture, `min_tokens` or `max_bs`. The default is `max_bs`.
- `VLLM_EXPONENTIAL_BUCKETING`: if `true`, enables exponential bucket spacing instead of linear. The default is `false`.
- `VLLM_{phase}_{dim}_BUCKET_{param}`: collection of 12 environment variables configuring ranges of bucketing mechanism (linear bucketing only).
  - `{phase}` is either `PROMPT` or `DECODE`
  - `{dim}` is either `BS`, `SEQ` or `BLOCK`
  - `{param}` is either `MIN`, `STEP` or `MAX`
  - Default values:
    - Prompt:

      - batch size min (`VLLM_PROMPT_BS_BUCKET_MIN`): `1`
      - batch size step (`VLLM_PROMPT_BS_BUCKET_STEP`): `min(max_num_seqs, 32)`
      - batch size max (`VLLM_PROMPT_BS_BUCKET_MAX`): `min(max_num_seqs, 64)`
      - sequence length min (`VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_MIN`): `block_size`
      - sequence length step (`VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_STEP`): `block_size`
      - sequence length max (`VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_MAX`): `1024`

    - Decode:

      - batch size min (`VLLM_DECODE_BS_BUCKET_MIN`): `1`
      - batch size step (`VLLM_DECODE_BS_BUCKET_STEP`): `min(max_num_seqs, 32)`
      - batch size max (`VLLM_DECODE_BS_BUCKET_MAX`): `max_num_seqs`
      - block size min (`VLLM_DECODE_BLOCK_BUCKET_MIN`): `block_size`
      - block size step (`VLLM_DECODE_BLOCK_BUCKET_STEP`): `block_size`
      - block size max (`VLLM_DECODE_BLOCK_BUCKET_MAX`): `max(128, (max_num_seqs*2048)/block_size)`
  - Recommended Values:
    - Prompt:

      - sequence length max (`VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_MAX`): `max_model_len`
    - Decode:

      - block size max (`VLLM_DECODE_BLOCK_BUCKET_MAX`): `max(128, (max_num_seqs*max_model_len/block_size)`

> [!NOTE]
> If the model config reports a high `max_model_len`, set it to max `input_tokens+output_tokens` rounded up to a multiple of `block_size` as per actual requirements.

> [!TIP]
> When a deployed workload does not utilize the full context that a model can handle, it is good practice to limit the maximum values upfront based on the input and output token lengths that will be generated after serving the vLLM server.<br><br>**Example:**<br><br>Let's assume that we want to deploy text generation model Qwen2.5-1.5B, which has a defined `max_position_embeddings` of 131072 (our `max_model_len`). At the same time, we know that our workload pattern will not use the full context length because we expect a maximum input token size of 1K and predict generating a maximum of 2K tokens as output. In this case, starting the vLLM server to be ready for the full context length is unnecessary. Instead, we should limit it upfront to achieve faster service preparation and decrease warmup time. The recommended values in this example should be:
> - `--max_model_len`: `3072` - the sum of input and output sequences (1+2)*1024.  
> - `VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_MAX`: `1024` - the maximum input token size that we expect to handle.

- `VLLM_HANDLE_TOPK_DUPLICATES`: if ``true`` - handles duplicates outside top-k. The default is `false`.
- `VLLM_CONFIG_HIDDEN_LAYERS`: configures how many hidden layers to run in a HPUGraph for model splitting among hidden layers when TP is 1.
    It helps to improve throughput by reducing inter-token latency limitations in some models. The default is `1`.

Additionally, there are HPU PyTorch Bridge environment variables impacting vLLM execution:

- `PT_HPU_LAZY_MODE`: if `0`, PyTorch Eager backend for Gaudi will be used. If `1`, PyTorch Lazy backend for Gaudi will be used. The default is `0`.

- `PT_HPU_ENABLE_LAZY_COLLECTIVES`: must be set to `true` for tensor parallel inference with HPU Graphs. The default is `true`.
- `PT_HPUGRAPH_DISABLE_TENSOR_CACHE`: must be set to `false` for LLaVA, qwen, and RoBERTa models. The default is `false`.
- `VLLM_PROMPT_USE_FLEX_ATTENTION`: enabled only for the Llama model, allowing usage of `torch.nn.attention.flex_attention` instead of FusedSDPA. Requires `VLLM_PROMPT_USE_FUSEDSDPA=0`. The default is `false`.

# Quantization, FP8 Inference and Model Calibration Process

> [!NOTE]
> Measurement files are required to run quantized models with vLLM on Gaudi accelerators. The FP8 model calibration procedure is described in detail in [docs.habana.ai vLLM Inference Section](https://docs.habana.ai/en/v1.21.3/PyTorch/Inference_on_PyTorch/vLLM_Inference/vLLM_FP8_Inference.html).
An end-to-end example tutorial for quantizing a BF16 Llama 3.1 model to FP8 and then inferencing is provided in this [Gaudi-tutorials repository](https://github.com/HabanaAI/Gaudi-tutorials/blob/main/PyTorch/vLLM_Tutorials/FP8_Quantization_using_INC/FP8_Quantization_using_INC.ipynb).

Once you have completed the model calibration process and collected the measurements, you can run FP8 inference with vLLM using the following command:

```bash
export QUANT_CONFIG=/path/to/quant/config/inc/meta-llama-3.1-405b-instruct/maxabs_quant_g3.json
vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len  2048 --block-size 128 --max-num-seqs 32 --quantization inc --kv-cache-dtype fp8_inc --weights-load-device cpu --tensor-parallel-size 8
```

`QUANT_CONFIG` is an environment variable that points to the measurement or quantization configuration file. The measurement configuration file is used during the calibration procedure to collect
measurements for a given model. The quantization configuration is used during inference.

> [!TIP]
> If you are prototyping or testing your model with FP8, you can use the `VLLM_SKIP_WARMUP=true` environment variable to disable the warmup stage, which is time-consuming.
However, disabling this feature in production environments is not recommended, as it can lead to a significant performance decrease.

> If you are benchmarking an FP8 model with `scale_format=const`, setting `VLLM_DISABLE_MARK_SCALES_AS_CONST=true` can help speed up the warmup stage.

> [!TIP]
> When using FP8 models, you may experience timeouts caused by the long compilation time of FP8 operations. To mitigate this, set the following environment variables:
> - `VLLM_ENGINE_ITERATION_TIMEOUT_S` - to adjust the vLLM server timeout. You can set the value in seconds, e.g., 600 equals 10 minutes.
> - `VLLM_RPC_TIMEOUT` - to adjust the RPC protocol timeout used by the OpenAI-compatible API. This value is in microseconds, e.g., 600000 equals 10 minutes.

# Long Context Support

Long context feature enables support for a token context window exceeding 128K tokens. It is supported by the following models:
- [meta-llama/Llama-2-7b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b)
- [meta-llama/Llama-2-70b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b)
- [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct)
- [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
- [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct)
- [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct)

## Environment Variables Settings

Set the following environment variables to avoid OOM/functional issues.  Additional environment variable settings depend on context length:

- `VLLM_ENGINE_ITERATION_TIMEOUT_S=3600`
- `VLLM_RPC_TIMEOUT=100000`
- `VLLM_PROMPT_USE_FUSEDSDPA=1`
- `PT_HPU_ENABLE_LAZY_COLLECTIVES=true`
- `PT_HPUGRAPH_DISABLE_TENSOR_CACHE=1`
- `VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=1`

**32K context length flags examples:**

- `VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM`: The value depends on the model and context length settings. Use `VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM=0.02` for Llama3.1-8B or `VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM=0.1` for Llama3.1-70B.
- `VLLM_PROMPT_BS_BUCKET_MIN=1`: Suggested value, depends on the model. You can increase it until you reach an OOM error or decrease it if OOM occurs.
- `VLLM_PROMPT_BS_BUCKET_STEP=16`: Suggested value, depends on the model. Increasing the step value results in fewer buckets. If an OOM error occurs, the value should be increased.
- `VLLM_PROMPT_BS_BUCKET_MAX=16`: Suggested value, depends on the model.  You can increase it until you reach an OOM error or decrease it if OOM occurs.
- `VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_MIN=24576`: Suggested value, depends on warmup results.
- `VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_STEP=2048`: Suggested value, depends on warmup results. It is recommended to increase it to a higher value for faster warmup. `VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_STEP=16384` - Suggested value for Intel Gaudi 3.
- `VLLM_PROMPT_SEQ_BUCKET_MAX=32768`: Value for context length of 32K. Use 16384 for 16K.
- `VLLM_DECODE_BLOCK_BUCKET_MIN=1024`: Suggested value, depends on warmup results.
- `VLLM_DECODE_BLOCK_BUCKET_STEP=1024`: Suggested value, depends on warmup results.
- `VLLM_DECODE_BLOCK_BUCKET_MAX=33792`: `max_num_seqs * max_decode_seq // self.block_size`, where `max_decode_seq` represents the sum of input and output sequences. For example:
  - `128 *((32 + 1)* 1024) / 128`
  - `32 *((32 + 1)* 1024) / 128`

## Batch Size Settings

The default `batch_size=256` is not optimal for long contexts (8K+). Recompilations may occur if there is not enough KV cache space for some sequence groups.

If recompilation or next recomputation warnings appear during inference, reduce `batch_size` to improve stability.

**Recompilation message example:**

```bash
Configuration: (prompt, 1, 36864) was not warmed-up!
```

**Warning message example:**

```bash
Sequence group cmpl-3cbf19b0c6d74b3f90b5d5db2ed2385e-0 is preempted by PreemptionMode.RECOMPUTE mode because there is not enough KV cache space. This can affect the end-to-end performance. Increase gpu_memory_utilization or tensor_parallel_size to provide more KV cache memory.
```

## Multi-Step Scheduling Feature Usage

Enabling Multi-Step Scheduling is recommended for better decode performance. Refer to vllm-project#6854 for more details.

# Pipeline Parallelism

Pipeline parallelism is a distributed model parallelization technique that splits the model vertically across its layers, distributing different parts of the model across multiple devices.
With this feature, when running a model that does not fit on a single node with tensor parallelism and requires a multi-node solution, we can split the model vertically across its layers and distribute the slices across available nodes.
For example, if we have two nodes, each with 8 HPUs, we no longer have to use `tensor_parallel_size=16` but can instead set `tensor_parallel_size=8` with pipeline_parallel_size=2.
Because pipeline parallelism runs a `pp_size` number of virtual engines on each device, we have to lower `max_num_seqs` accordingly, since it acts as a micro batch for each virtual engine.

## Running Pipeline Parallelism

The following example shows how to use Pipeline parallelism with vLLM on HPU:

```bash
vllm serve <model_path> --device hpu --tensor-parallel-size 8 --pipeline_parallel_size 2 --distributed-executor-backend ray
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, pipeline parallelism on Lazy mode requires the `PT_HPUGRAPH_DISABLE_TENSOR_CACHE=0` flag.

# Multi-node Support

vLLM works with a multi-node environment setup via Ray. To run models on multiple nodes, follow the procedure below.

## Prerequisites
Perform the following on all nodes:

- Install the latest [vllm-fork](https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork/blob/habana_main/README_GAUDI.md#build-and-install-vllm).

- Check if all Gaudi NIC ports are up by running:

> [!NOTE]
> Following commands should be run on the host and NOT inside the container.

```bash
cd /opt/habanalabs/qual/gaudi2/bin 
./manage_network_ifs.sh --status 
# All the ports should be in 'up' state. Try flipping the state
./manage_network_ifs.sh --down 
./manage_network_ifs.sh --up
# Give it a minute for the NIC's to flip and check the status again
```

- Set the following flags:

```bash
# Check the network interface for outbound/inbound comms. Command 'ip a' or 'ifconfig' should list all the interfaces
export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0
export HCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0
```

## 1. Start Ray on the head node:

```bash
ray start --head --port=6379
```

## 2. Add workers to the Ray cluster:

```bash
ray start --address='<ip-of-ray-head-node>:6379'
```

## 3. Start the vLLM server:

```bash
vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len  2048 --block-size 128 --max-num-seqs 32 --tensor-parallel-size 16 --distributed-executor-backend ray
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running FP8 models with a multi-node setup is described in the documentation of FP8 calibration procedure: [README](https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-hpu-extension/blob/main/calibration/README.md).

# Troubleshooting

The following steps address Out of Memory related errors:
- Increase `gpu_memory_utilization` - This addresses insufficient overall memory. The vLLM pre-allocates HPU cache by using `gpu_memory_utilization%` of device memory. By default, `gpu_memory_utilization` is set to 0.9. By increasing this utilization, you can provide more KV cache space.
- Decrease `max_num_seqs` or `max_num_batched_tokens` - This may reduce the number of concurrent requests in a batch, thereby requiring less KV cache space when overall usable memory is limited.
- Increase `tensor_parallel_size` - This approach shards model weights, so each GPU has more memory available for KV cache.
- To maximize the memory available for the KV cache, you can disable `HPUGraph` completely. With HPU Graphs disabled, you are trading latency and throughput at lower batches for potentially higher throughput on higher batches. You can do that by adding `--enforce-eager` flag to the server (for online inference), or by passing `enforce_eager=True` argument to LLM constructor (for offline inference).
